Playwright allows users to group tests into suits, use custom tags to run tagged tests in batches or skip/target specific tests.
1. skip
    test.skip("ignored", async ({page}) =>{
    skipped test
    })

2. only
    test.only(...)
only tests marked like this will execute, others are ignored

3. describe
    //describe is not an asynchronous function, so no need for async
    test.describe("description", () => {
        tests come in here
    })
