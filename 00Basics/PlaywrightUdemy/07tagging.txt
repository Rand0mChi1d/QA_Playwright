Playwright allows putting tags in place and run all tests with specific tags

test("description @nameOfTheTag", async {(page)} => {

})


in console: npx playwright test --grep @nameOfTheTag
to run all tagged tests

in console: npx playwright test --grep-invert @nameOfTheTag
to run all tests that don't have this tag



You can also put tags onto test suit and add multiple tags to one test:

test("description @tag1 @tag2 tag3", async {(page)} => {

})
