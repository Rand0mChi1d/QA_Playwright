In all frameworks, you're able to run some code before and after the test

test.describe.only("Hooks", () => {
    test.beforeEach(async ({ page } => {
        await page.goto("https://example.com/")
    })
    //will run this before every test in the group


    test.beforeAll(async ({ page }) => {
        ...
    })
    //will run this once, before tests

    test.afterAll(...)
    test.afterEach(...)
