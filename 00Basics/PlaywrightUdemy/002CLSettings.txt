changing testing to visible(feasible???) mode and swapping default browser for testing in cycles

npx playwright test --headed      (browser will visibly open when proceduring)
npx playwright test --browser=firefox     (for example)

if the browser input is not recognized:
Error: Unsupported browser "chrome", must be one of "all", "chromium", "firefox" or "webkit"
--browser=all tests in all awailable browsers

We can specify a relative path so that only the chosen test is ran
npx playwright test tests/example.spec.ts
