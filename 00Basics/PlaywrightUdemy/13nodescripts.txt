We can add scripts to package.json file to avoid excessive typing into terminal
there we create  a construct like
"tests:chrome": "npx playwright test --config=playwright.config.ts --project=Chromium",
"tests:webkit": "npx playwright test --config=playwright.config.ts --project=Webkit"...

now, via command: npm run tests:chrome  
we run that line easily from the scripts

to tweak parameters like we used to (--headed, --reporter=...), in console, after the npm command put "--" and overwrite configuration:
npm run tests:chrome -- --headed --reporter=dot
