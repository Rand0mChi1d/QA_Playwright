in playwright it's a common practice to have a different config file for different suit of tests, such as
end to end, regression or smoke screen tests
in the e2e.config.ts file, we add a line:
//  retries: 0,    
    testDir: "tests/e2e",    - this line is responsible for singling out test folder for the npx playwright launch
//  use: {

then, we alter node script in package.json
